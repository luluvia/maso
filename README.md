# MaSO - Message and Status Output

**Message and Status Output (MaSO)** is a Rust program that prints a message
and a status, based on enabled features, to the desired output. The goal is to
provide the functionality of other "message of the day" programs. What makes
MaSO stand out is the scripting functionality provided by Rhai.

There are no prerequisites to run MaSO. However, if you wish to install MaSO
from Cargo, you will need to install Rust and Cargo.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install maso
```

Prebuilt binaries are coming soon!

## Usage

```bash
maso
```
